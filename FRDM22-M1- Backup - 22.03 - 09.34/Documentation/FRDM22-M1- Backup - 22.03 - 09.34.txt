Module "indicationModbus" (component BitIO)
   - indicationModbus_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is 
                read and returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - indicationModbus_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to 
                a memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - indicationModbus_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - indicationModbus_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "enableModbus" (component BitIO)
   - enableModbus_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read 
                and returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property 
                for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - enableModbus_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - enableModbus_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - enableModbus_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "modbusSerial" (component AsynchroSerial)
   - modbusSerial_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it 
                does not wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the 
                preferred method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and 
                <OnBreak> the return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the 
                information about an exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be 
                read.
   - modbusSerial_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) 
                SendChar method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one 
                character can be stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. 
                This method is available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - modbusSerial_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental 
                error), otherwise it returns an error code (it does not wait for data).  This method is available only if 
                non-zero length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested 
                number of characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user 
                specified destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter 
                is set to the number of received characters.
   - modbusSerial_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of 
                the output buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.
   - modbusSerial_ClearRxBuf -Clears the receive buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the input buffer 
                is defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - modbusSerial_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output 
                buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - modbusSerial_CharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the 
                receiver property is enabled.  [deprecated method]
   - modbusSerial_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the 
                receiver property is enabled.
   - modbusSerial_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.
